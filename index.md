## What is MRTD Kit?

MRTD Kit is a set of libraries and applications that provide functionality for validating travel documents, such as Passports, Visas and ID cards.

The format of these documents is defined by the ICAO 9303 document series, which the library strictly adheres to.

## Getting Started

The `validation` library contains everything you need to get started with MRTD kit.





### Components
